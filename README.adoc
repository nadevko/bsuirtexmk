== Standard with a human face

ENSTD is simply inhumane. There are a lot of letters, it's hard to remember, it's
hard to read. For a mere mortal student -- an impossible task. Not everyone has
an obedient ksisarian, right? :3

This project is designed to simplify life a little by presenting the material in
an accessible form and implementing auxiliary tools for automating
documentation process.
